## Highlights
- Affects buildings greater than 25,000 square feet
- Sets increasingly stringent limits on carbon emissions per square foot in 2024 and 2030
- Flexibility to comply through renewable energy credits and/or emissions offsets
- Allows some affordable housing to choose low-cost energy-saving measures instead of emissions limits
- New Office of Building Energy and Emissions Performance at the Department of Buildings
- Strong advisory board to help refine emissions metrics and limits
- Carbon trading study and implementation plan
- Penalties for non-compliance and variances for financial hardship
- Local Law 97 is a key component of New York City's Climate Mobilization Act aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from large buildings.

## Impact
- Covers ~50,000 buildings and nearly 60 percent of the city's building area: 59 percent residential and 41 percent commercial (Fig 2).
- Requires 40 percent citywide emissions reductions by 2030 from a 2005 baseline.
- For covered buildings, that's a 26 percent carbon cut (5.3 million metric tons) from today, the equivalent of San Francisco's citywide emissions.
- Many buildings are significantly above emissions limits and will require comprehensive retrofits or alternate compliance by 2030.
- Affected buildings include all properties over 25,000 square feet, including residential, commercial, and mixed-use buildings. Notably, certain buildings such as those with fewer than 35 percent rent-regulated units may have different compliance requirements.
- Long-term goals include aligning with New York City's broader climate action plan, which aims for an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.


## Support
- Low-interest loans available through a new Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program to finance energy efficiency and green energy through a special assessment on a building's property tax bill.
- First compliance report due May 1, 2025 (and every May thereafter).
