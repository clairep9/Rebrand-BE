# Decarbonization

The decarbonization pathway under NYC Local Law 97 (LL97) is a strategic approach designed to help buildings in New York City meet their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets. The pathway outlines a series of steps and requirements for reducing carbon emissions over time to achieve the city’s ambitious climate goals.

## Key Aspects of the Decarbonization Pathway

### 1. Understanding the Decarbonization Pathway

**Objective:**
- The goal is to guide buildings through a structured approach to significantly cut down on their GHG emissions, ultimately achieving near-zero emissions by 2050.

**Scope:**
- The pathway applies to buildings that are subject to LL97's emissions limits, which include most large buildings in NYC.

### 2. Pathway Components

#### a. Baseline Emissions Analysis:
- **Initial Assessment:** Buildings must start by assessing their current emissions profile. This involves measuring baseline GHG emissions and identifying sources of carbon output.
- **Data Collection:** Accurate data collection is crucial. This typically includes energy consumption data, fuel use, and emissions factors.

#### b. Setting Reduction Targets:
- **Short-Term Goals:** Buildings must establish short-term emission reduction goals that align with LL97’s interim targets, which are set for 2024 and 2030.
- **Long-Term Goals:** The ultimate goal is to achieve 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 compared to a 2005 baseline.

#### c. Action Plan Development:
- **Energy Efficiency Upgrades:** Implementing measures to improve energy efficiency, such as upgrading HVAC systems, improving insulation, and installing energy-efficient lighting.
- **Renewable Energy Integration:** Incorporating renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
- **Technological Innovations:** Exploring and adopting new technologies that can lower emissions, such as advanced heating and cooling systems or energy storage solutions.

#### d. Financial Planning:
- **Budgeting:** Developing a financial plan to support the implementation of decarbonization measures. This includes budgeting for both capital expenditures and operational costs.
- **Funding Sources:** Identifying potential funding sources, such as government incentives, grants, or energy efficiency programs.

#### e. Implementation and Monitoring:
- **Project Execution:** Carrying out the planned upgrades and changes according to the developed action plan.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly monitoring energy use and emissions to ensure compliance with reduction targets and to identify areas for further improvement.

#### f. Reporting and Compliance:
- **Regular Reporting:** Submitting periodic reports to the relevant authorities detailing progress towards emissions reduction targets.
- **Verification:** Ensuring that emissions reductions are verified by third-party auditors if required by the law.

### 3. Compliance and Enforcement

#### a. Compliance Requirements:
- Buildings are required to adhere to the reduction targets set forth in their decarbonization pathway. Failure to do so may result in penalties or fines.

#### b. Enforcement Mechanisms:
- **Inspections:** Periodic inspections by city officials to ensure that buildings are following their decarbonization plans.
- **Penalties:** Financial penalties for non-compliance or failure to meet reduction targets.

### 4. Support and Resources

#### a. Technical Assistance:
- **Consulting Services:** Buildings can seek assistance from energy consultants and experts to develop and implement their decarbonization plans.
- **Training Programs:** Participation in training programs or workshops to better understand energy efficiency and emissions reduction strategies.

#### b. Financial Incentives:
- **Grants and Rebates:** Availability of grants, rebates, and other financial incentives to support the cost of implementing energy-efficient upgrades and renewable energy systems.

## Summary

The decarbonization pathway under LL97 is a comprehensive framework designed to help buildings systematically reduce their GHG emissions. It involves a thorough analysis of current emissions, setting and meeting reduction targets, implementing energy-efficient measures, and ensuring ongoing compliance through monitoring and reporting. By following this pathway, buildings contribute to NYC’s broader climate goals and work towards a more sustainable future.
