# Article 321: Compliance Pathways for Certain Buildings  

## Overview  
Article 321 of New York City's Local Law 97 (LL97) provides specific compliance pathways for certain buildings, including those with more than 35% rent-regulated units, houses of worship, and some subsidized housing. These buildings, referred to as "Article 321 buildings," have two primary options to achieve compliance by 2024:  

## 1. Prescriptive Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs)  
- Implement a set of predefined, low-cost energy efficiency upgrades by **December 31, 2024**.  
- These measures are designed to improve energy performance and reduce emissions.  
- A report certified by a **retro-commissioning agent** confirming the implementation of these measures is due by **May 1, 2025**.  

## 2. 2030 Emissions Limits  
- Demonstrate that the building's annual emissions for 2024 do not exceed the stricter carbon limits set for the **2030–2034 period**.  
- This requires a report certified by a **registered design professional**, also due by **May 1, 2025**.  

## Compliance and Penalties  
Failure to comply with these requirements may result in **penalties**. However, the **Department of Buildings (DOB)** emphasizes promoting compliance over imposing fines and may offer flexibility to building owners who can demonstrate progress or face unforeseen challenges.  

### Special Considerations  
- Buildings affected by **unexpected disasters** or those undertaking **eligible energy conservation projects** with housing agencies may be eligible for **mitigated penalties or extensions**.  
- The DOB may offer a **mediated resolution** for non-compliant buildings that submit:  
  - An **attestation of non-compliance**  
  - The **previous year's benchmarking data**  
  - A **compliance plan** detailing how they will meet the 2030 carbon limits or complete the applicable prescriptive measures  

This approach aims to **facilitate compliance** while considering the unique circumstances of each building.  

## Conclusion  
Article 321 provides **alternative compliance pathways and support mechanisms** to assist specific buildings in meeting **LL97’s emissions reduction goals**, recognizing the diverse challenges they may face.
