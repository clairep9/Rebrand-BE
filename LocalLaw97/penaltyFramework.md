## Penalty Framework

### 1. Emission Limit Violations
#### a. Issuance of Notice of Violation (NOV):
- **Over Limit Detection:** If a building exceeds its allowable emissions limit as specified by LL97, the Department of Buildings (DOB) identifies this violation.
- **NOV Issuance:** The DOB issues a Notice of Violation (NOV) to the building owner. This NOV details the nature of the violation and includes a full penalty amount that the building owner must pay.

#### b. Penalty Payment Options:
- **Payment of Penalty:** The building owner can choose to pay the penalty amount specified in the NOV. This is a straightforward option but does not address the underlying issue of emissions non-compliance.
- **Adjudication by Trial at OATH:** Alternatively, the building owner can contest the NOV. They have the option to request an adjudication hearing at the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH). OATH conducts trials to resolve disputes between the city and building owners regarding violations.

### 2. Mediated Resolution
#### a. Eligibility for Mediation:
- **Qualifying Buildings:** For buildings that meet specific criteria (which may involve demonstrating good faith efforts or facing particular challenges), the DOB might offer a mediated resolution.
- **Legally Binding Agreement:** In this mediation process, the DOB and the building owner can enter into a legally binding agreement. This agreement outlines specific actions that the building owner must take to address the emissions violation and prevent future occurrences.

#### b. Agreement Terms:
- **Action Plan:** The agreement typically includes an action plan detailing the steps the building owner needs to follow to reduce emissions and comply with LL97.
- **Timeline:** The agreement may set deadlines or milestones for implementing changes and achieving compliance.

#### c. Annual Emissions Report:
- **Submission Requirement:** As part of the agreement, the building owner must continue to submit annual emissions reports to the DOB. These reports provide updates on the building's emissions and confirm whether the owner is adhering to the terms of the agreement.

### 3. Non-Compliance Consequences
#### a. Enforcement of Penalties:
- **Breach of Agreement:** If the building owner fails to comply with the terms of the legally binding agreement, the DOB has the authority to enforce the penalties specified in the NOV.
- **Penalty Reinstatement:** In such cases, the DOB issues the penalties that were initially suspended or reduced due to the agreement. This means the building owner is liable to pay the full penalty amount that was previously set aside.

## Summary
In summary, if a building exceeds its emissions limit under LL97, the DOB will issue a Notice of Violation (NOV) with a full penalty amount. The building owner can either pay this penalty or contest it through a trial at the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH). For buildings that qualify, the DOB may offer a mediated resolution in the form of a legally binding agreement. This agreement requires the building owner to take specific actions and submit annual emissions reports. Failure to adhere to the agreement results in the reinstatement of the original penalties.

- **Maximum annual penalty** is the difference between a buildingâ€™s annual emissions limit and its actual emissions multiplied by $268.
