# Article 320: Good Faith Efforts

## 1. Context  
Article 320 addresses the situation where buildings face challenges in meeting energy and emissions reduction targets set by LL97 due to factors such as technological limitations or financial constraints.

## 2. Requirements  
- **Demonstration of Efforts**: Buildings must show that they have made reasonable and concerted efforts to reduce their GHG emissions, even if they are unable to meet all compliance targets.  
- **Documentation**: Building owners are required to provide documentation of their efforts, including any measures taken to upgrade energy systems, implement energy-saving technologies, or invest in renewable energy sources.  
- **Financial Constraints**: If financial constraints are cited, building owners must provide evidence of their financial situation and the economic challenges faced. This could include financial statements, cost estimates for proposed upgrades, or documentation of funding attempts.  
- **Technical Constraints**: In cases where technical limitations prevent compliance, building owners must detail the specific barriers and provide evidence of consultations with experts or attempts to overcome these issues.  

## 3. Approval Process  
- **Submission**: The good faith effort documentation is typically submitted to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or another designated authority.  
- **Review**: The reviewing body assesses whether the efforts made by the building owner are adequate and whether they align with the lawâ€™s intent.  
- **Determination**: If the efforts are deemed sufficient, the building may be granted an extension or reduced penalty. If not, the building owner might face fines or other penalties.  

## 4. Penalties and Extensions  
Buildings that can demonstrate good faith efforts may be granted extensions or reduced penalties. The extent of relief or extension granted depends on the evaluation of the efforts and the specific circumstances of the building.  

## 5. Best Practices  
- **Proactive Planning**: Start early in assessing energy use and emissions to identify potential challenges and solutions.  
- **Expert Consultation**: Work with energy consultants or engineers to develop a feasible plan for meeting compliance.  
- **Documentation**: Keep thorough records of all efforts, expenditures, and consultations to support claims of good faith.
